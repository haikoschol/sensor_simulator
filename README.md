sensor_simulator
================

This is a simple simulator for a Kobold SEM 3 pressure sensor. I wrote it to facilitate testing on a freelance programming job. It's only what I needed at the time and not robust or polished in any way, since it was not part of the deliverables. IIRC, there are some threading issues, among other things. If you want to try it (for whatever reason), make sure you have wxPython and pyserial installed. If it won't start, check whether the configuration file contains a valid name for a serial port on your machine.
